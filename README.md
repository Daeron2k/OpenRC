Repo for the OpenRC Printable Radio Controlled Vehicles Project. Contains printable parts, instructions, and parts sourcing info. Based on the [Google Group here](https://plus.google.com/communities/112745535856143176146)

Currently holds only a Truggy, but future vehicles can be added.

## File Organization
I've taken a whack at organizing the files, but please let me know if you want to be added to the repo and organize even more/better.

### Old Files
I've kept the early revision files of various parts in here for posterity, but in the future, we can much more easily rely on Git's versioning history.
