# Open RC

Repo for the OpenRC Printable Radio Controlled Vehicles Project. Contains printable parts, instructions, and parts sourcing info. Based on the [Google Group here](https://plus.google.com/communities/112745535856143176146)

Currently holds only a Truggy, but future vehicles can be added.

## File Organization
I've taken a whack at organizing the files, but please let me know if you want to be added to the repo and organize even more/better.

### Old Files
I've kept the early revision files of various parts in here for posterity, but in the future, we can much more easily rely on Git's versioning history.

As far as I can tell, nearly everything here was designed by a fantastic Swede named Daniel Norée, so Tak Så Mycket to Dan.
