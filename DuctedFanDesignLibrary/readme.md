# Ducted Fan Design Library
An electric ducted fan design library written in Python using the Blender API. Currently, the software is in script form, but an add-on of sorts is being created.

## Instructions

 * Split the default 3d window vertically and open the text editor in the new left window.
 * In the text editor open **EDFLibrary.py**, **DLUtils.py**, **TurboMachLib.py** and **GUI.py**
 * Run the **GUI.py** script
 * New tools will appear in the object tools pane of the 3D window on the right.
